When a new _Object type_ is created by an _Instance admin (_seeÂ [New Entity Type Registration)](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation-openbis-19-06-4/new-entity-type-registration/)_,_ the storage widget is disabled by default.

  
If we want to track storage positions for this particular _Object type_, the **Storage** should be enabled in the **Settings**, under **Utilities**. This can be done by a _group admin_.

For this, follow the steps below:  
  

1. Go to **Settings**, under **Utilities**
2. Click the **Edit** button
3. Scroll to the last section of the Settings: **Object Type definitions Extension**
4. Open the _Object type_ for which you want to enable the storage, e.g. **Chemical**
5. Select **Enable Storage** 
6. Save
