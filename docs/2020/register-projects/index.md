In a personal folder, users can register one or more _Projects_ they currently work on. _Projects_ in openBIS only have a **Description** field, no additional fields can be added.  
  

1. Navigate to the relevant _Space_Â in the _Lab Notebook_ menu and click the **+** button.
2. _Projects_ do not have a **Name** field, but only **Code**. Codes can only take alphanumeric characters and no spaces. Codes are prettified in the Main Menu.
3. Enter a **Description** for the project.
4. Click **Save** on top of the form.
