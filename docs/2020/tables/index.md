All tables in the ELN have the same format and similar functionalities:

> 1. **Filter**_._ When multiple values are entered in the Filter field, the filtering can be performed in two ways:
>     1. Table AND. This performs an AND search across all entities listed in the table.
>     2. Global OR. This performs an OR search on all entities to which the user has access in the database.
> 2. **Table download.** Tables can be exported in different ways, from the _Options_ drop down menu,.  Please remember NOT TO USE plain text tables for batch update!
> 3. **Column display**_._ Users can select which properties to display from the _Columns_ drop down menu. This information is stored in the database for each user.
> 4. **Delete multiple entities.** Users can select multiple entities in a table and then choose the _Delete selected_ option from the _Options_ drop down menu.

In all tables there is an **Operations** column, which allow users to perform certain tasks on an _Object_:

> 1. Open the hierarchy graph.
> 2. Open the hierarchy table.
> 3. Upload a file to the Object.
> 4. Move the Object to another Experiment/Collection.
