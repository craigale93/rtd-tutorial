When a new _Object type_ is registered by an _Instance admin,_ the storage widget is disabled by default.

  
If we want to track storage positions for this particular _Object type_, the **Storage** should be enabled in the **Settings**, under **Utilities**.

For this, follow the steps below:  
  

1. Scroll to the last section of the Settings: **Object Type definitions Extension**
2. open the _Object type_ for which you want to enable the storage, e.g. **Chemical**
3. Select **Enable Storage**
